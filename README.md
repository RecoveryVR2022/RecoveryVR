## What is RecoveryVR
Virtual Reality, often called VR in short, is a system that enables a user to intuitively view or traverse a simulated worldspace. A VR headset, when strapped on, provides 180 degree view similar to human perception in real life. The VR headset can turn or lean the viewpoint by tracking the movement of userâ€™s head, achieving a synchronized experience. With the help of a pair of VR controllers, the relative movement of both hands can be reflected into the simulated world, making the experience more believable and intuitive. Thanks to this, VR technology is very popular among rehabitation and work education industry, since it greatly reduce the learning cost while providing a controlled environment for activities.

However, most common commercial VR products comes without a tracking solution for lower body. While being merely a minor inconvinence for other applications, this is impeding for rehabitation using VR. Lower body workouts are inapplicable without tracking leg movements, and not seeing their lower body movement was reported to be distracting by participants which reduces the capability and effectiveness of such rehabitation.

The goal of this project is to develop a simple system where a VR user can set up their phone or computer nearby and use the camera on the device to track the users body and send that position data to the VR application. The VR user would be able to look down at their virtual body and move their legs and elbows in the VR environment.

This project will be a prototype to prove the potential of the idea. The prototype will then be developed further to create an api that can be integrated into any VR application and used with any game.

This simple technique could have huge ramifications in the entire VR industry across workplace training, fitness, elite sport, healthcare and gaming.
